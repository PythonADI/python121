# Python Basics for Beginners

Here are some important topics to get started with Python:

1. **🧮 Values, Variables, and Data Types**
   - A *value* is a piece of data (like a number or text).
   - A *variable* is a name that stores a value.
   - *Data types* include numbers (int, float), text (str), etc.

2. **🏷️ How to Name a Variable**
   - Use letters, numbers, and underscores (e.g., my_variable).
   - Variable names cannot start with a number.
   - Choose names that describe what the variable stores.

3. **🟰 Assignment Operators**
   - Use `=` to assign a value to a variable. Example: `x = 5`
   - You can also use `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=` for updating values.

4. **➗ Arithmetic Operators**
   - Used for math: `+` (add), `-` (subtract), `*` (multiply), `/` (divide), `%` (remainder)

5. **🔍 Comparison Operators**
   - Compare values: `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal), `>` (greater), `<` (less), `>=`, `<=`

6. **🔗 Logical Operators**
   - Combine conditions: `and`, `or`, `not`

7. **🔀 If Statements**
   - Run code only if a condition is true. Example:
     ```python
     if x > 0:
         print("x is positive")
     ```

8. **⌨️ Input Function**
   - Get user input: `input("Enter your name: ")`

9. **🔁 While Loops**
   - Repeat code while a condition is true. Example:
     ```python
     count = 0
     while count < 5:
         print(count)
         count += 1
     ```
